Title: A High-Performance Interface to the MuPDF Library
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Mikael Moise", email = "mikaelmoise00@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides R bindings to the MuPDF library, a lightweight, high-performance
    PDF, XPS, and E-book viewer, renderer, and toolkit. This package allows for
    fast text extraction, page rendering to PNG images, and extraction of
    embedded images from PDF documents directly within R. Advanced PDF editing
    (such as deleting pages) is performed by calling the external tool 'mutool'
    from R. Image insertion is not available in this version.
